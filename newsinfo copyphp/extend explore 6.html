     <p class="card-text">This Indian startup converts your smartphone into a tour guide. Imagine you're on a holiday trip to Paris, visiting the ...Travel startups today are not creating products as much as platforms that facilitate connections between travelers and locals in the destination that they wish to explore.

It might, however, take more than a website and a messaging function to attract the number of users that makes the site useful and comprehensive, on both sides of the equation.Imagine you’re on a holiday trip to Paris, visiting the Louvre for the first time. Your guide book tells you it’s one of the top 10 things to do while in Paris. However, on reaching the Louvre, you have absolutely no idea what to do next. You might follow the crowd cluelessly or rely on the judgment of a tour guide –  being constantly herded around as part of a big group, and sticking to someone else’s schedule. To address these universal travel woes, Mumbai-based startup Guiddoo created an app for travellers that acts as a smart alternative to expensive tour guides.

The app offers audiovisual tour guides and walking tours of historical, cultural, and art destinations. It acts like a personal tour guide and offers key insights, history and trivia, timelines and places of interest, and other essential tourist information. It even enables users to book tours and buy tickets to several major tourist destinations around the world.
